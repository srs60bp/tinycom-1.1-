Description: TinyCom
        =======
        
        A simple line based serial terminal GUI written in Python. This is a
        tool that's useful for talking to a variety of serial based hardware
        that can involve custom protocols or just a standard command line
        interface. It runs on anything that supports Python and Qt.
        
        TinyCom is inspired by the original
        `CuteCom <http://cutecom.sourceforge.net/>`__.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Line oriented input and output, with configurable line ending.
        -  Customizeable serial port configuration.
        -  Automatically enumerates platform serial ports.
        -  History of input lines, to easily regenerate them with a click.
        -  Log the session to a file.
        
        Runtime Requirements
        --------------------
        
        This is just an overview of runtime requirements. All major versions of
        both the Python interpreter and QT API are supported.
        
        -  `Python2 or Python3 <https://www.python.org/>`__
        -  `PyQt4 or
           PyQt5 <https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`__ or
           `PySide <https://wiki.qt.io/PySide>`__
        -  `Qt <https://www.qt.io/>`__
        -  `pySerial <https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial>`__
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        For simplicity, instructions for only PyQt4 and Python2 are listed here.
        However, you can adjust to use any combination of Python2/Python3 and
        PyQt4/PyQt5/Pyside if you prefer when it comes to runtime dependencies.
        
        On Ubuntu, first install dependencies using the system package manager.
        
        ::
        
            sudo apt-get install python python-qt4 python-serial python-pip
        
        Then, use pip to install tinycom.
        
        ::
        
            pip install [--user] tinycom
        
        Or, if you're installing from source:
        
        ::
        
            pip install [--user] tinycom-<version>.tar.bz2
        
        The --user option causes tinycom to be installed in your home directory
        under ~/.local.
        
        Then, if you somehow get fed up with TinyCom's awesomeness, uninstall
        it.
        
        ::
        
            pip uninstall tinycom
        
        Running
        -------
        
        Just execute ``tinycom``.

        PyQt4/PyQt5/PySide
        ------------------
        
        TinyCom can use PyQt4, PyQt5, or PySide for its Qt API. As long as you
        have one installed, it will be automatically detected and used at
        runtime. However, if you wish to force a specific Qt API, you can set
        the QT\_API environment variable to one of the following values when
        running.
        
        ::
        
            QT_API=pyqt4 tinycom
            QT_API=pyqt5 tinycom
            QT_API=pyside tinycom
